        <h1> What is JavaSript</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>JavaScript is a high level and it means it is easy for human to understand.<br>
            In term of interpreted programming, Java translate its own code into 1 byte and store it dynamically.<br>
            It is primarily a client-side langaguage. It means it does not need a server to run. <br>
            There are 2 ways to run css. First way is inline, which you include a script right before body. Second is
            through a separate css file and you link that folder/file to html. <br>
            CSS only allow to use literal vxsariable. The value in Boolean for js is true and false.<br>
            A string can be doble quote &#xFF02;and&#x2019; <br>
            In order to set a variable in JavaScript we need to use the word &#xFF02;let&#xFF02;.
